# Forest cover type prediction in Roosevelt National Forest of Northern Colorado

This is a [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/overview)

This repository contains some notebooks to analyze the problem and create a machine learning model to predict the cover type in Roosevelt National Forest.

## Problem description

In this competition you are asked to predict the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables (as opposed to remotely sensed data). The actual forest cover type for a given 30 x 30 meter cell was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data. Independent variables were then derived from data obtained from the US Geological Survey and USFS. The data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary columns of data for qualitative independent variables such as wilderness areas and soil type.
